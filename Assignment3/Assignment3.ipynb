    "Let $G(V,E)$ be a complete directed weighted graph with tiles as vertices $V$, and euclidean distances between tiles $i,j$ as weights $c_{ij}$. Denote by $\\delta^+(v)$ all input edges and by $\\delta^-(v)$ all output edges. Consider $f(e)\\geq 0$ to be a flow through the edge $e$, $f(i,j)$ (in shorter notation, $f_{ij}$) corresponds to amount of ground transferred from tile $i$ to $j$. We also need to define demands and supplies $b_i=g'_i-g_i$ for each tile $i$, where $g_i$ is the current amount of ground at $i$ and $g'_i$ is the goal one. Negative $b_i$ note that there it too much ground while the positive ones show the demand for additional ground. Summing up, we have the following $LP$ problem.\n",
